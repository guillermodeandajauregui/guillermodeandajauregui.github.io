      <description>These are some final impressions after my first Netsci conference:
 Logistics and organization were quite impressive. Satellites, parallel sessions and keynotes were all comfortable. Also, sessions were nearby, so slipping in and out was possible. No strong opinion on the lack of cookies during coffee breaks.
 The quality of keynotes was excellent, covering many aspects relevant to network scientists. My personal favorite was C. Brandon Ogbunu talk on epistasis.</description>
