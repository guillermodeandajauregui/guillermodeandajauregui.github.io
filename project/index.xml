      <description>Network Biology of Breast Cancer: High-throughput, multi-omics data of breast cancer can be studied through the use of network approaches. Some of the things me and my colleagues have studied include:
 How transcriptional networks capture the heterogeneity of breast cancer molecular subtypes.
 Differences in the modular structure of breast cancer networks and subtype-specific functions associated to certain subtypes of breast cancer.
 The loss of inter-chromosomal co-expression in breast cancer, and how information-theoretical approaches can be used to study this spatial organization phenomena.</description>
