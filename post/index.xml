      <description>Last month, Dr. Hugo Tovar and I were chatting about computational biology and some common missunderstandings we’d experienced:
 That all CompBio people are interchangeable in our interests and skills. That we were just waiting around for experimental biologists to share their data with us, with no research interests of our own. That our role was closer to a service core facility than independent research.  We took the proactive approach, talked with the head of the department, Dr.</description>

      <description>LANET is a conference on the path to become the referent for network science in Latin America. These are some thoughts after participating in the second edition in Cartagena, Colombia:
 The organizing committe did a good job with the general logistics. The venue was quite comfortable for most academic activities.
 Transportation arrangements to and from the venue (located just outside the city of Cartagena) were adequate.
 The lunch services gave us a nice taste of colombian food (arepas de huevo and carimañolas are awesome).</description>

      <description>These are some final impressions after my first Netsci conference:
 Logistics and organization were quite impressive. Satellites, parallel sessions and keynotes were all comfortable. Also, sessions were nearby, so slipping in and out was possible. No strong opinion on the lack of cookies during coffee breaks.
 The quality of keynotes was excellent, covering many aspects relevant to network scientists. My personal favorite was C. Brandon Ogbunu talk on epistasis.</description>
