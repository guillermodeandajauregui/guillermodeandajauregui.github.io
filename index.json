Satellites, parallel sessions and keynotes were all comfortable. Also, sessions were nearby, so slipping in and out was possible. No strong opinion on the lack of cookies during coffee breaks.\n The quality of keynotes was excellent, covering many aspects relevant to network scientists. My personal favorite was C. Brandon Ogbunu talk on epistasis.\n Some research trends called my attention: particularly, the different Machine Learning techniques based on networks and network embeddings.\n In the field of network biology, the topics of controllability and stable motifs were highlighted. Speaking of NetBio, I felt that this community was slightly isolated from the main conference; particularly the BioMed-network community. The epidemiology and ecology people seemed to be more integrated. Makes me wonder what is our role in the greater Network Science community…\n The role of network science in society was a prevalent theme. Most keynote speakers touched on it: Duncan Watts and fake news; Tina Elissei saying that ethics belongs to the NetSci community; HyeJin Youn and Eleanor Power calling out against WEIRD data… and there was the Network Science for Social Good satellite…\n Diversity was another important topic, driven by the Diversify Netsci satellite. It is very clear that there is a long way to go. My impression is that the attendants to the conference were predominantly USA-based (although they were less than 50%); maybe one step should be to diversify the discussion on diversity… but how to do so? That is a hard question… In any case, the conversation got started, which is always a good thing.\n Related, a spanish-speaking community emerged during the conference, which may be a good starting point for joint efforts on shared goals.\n  I really enjoyed my Netsci 2019 experience. Burlington, VT is a beautiful place, and offered a great space to discuss network science. Until next time.\n","date":1559779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559779200,"objectID":"6677a2c35e7084084be634eb6a67d7e4","permalink":"/post/some-thoughts-after-netsci-2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/some-thoughts-after-netsci-2019/","section":"post","summary":"These are some final impressions after my first Netsci conference:\n Logistics and organization were quite impressive.

Some of the things me and my colleagues have studied include:\n How transcriptional networks capture the heterogeneity of breast cancer molecular subtypes.\n Differences in the modular structure of breast cancer networks and subtype-specific functions associated to certain subtypes of breast cancer.\n The loss of inter-chromosomal co-expression in breast cancer, and how information-theoretical approaches can be used to study this spatial organization phenomena.\n The emergence of non-redundant, highly connected (“commodore”) micro-RNAs, and their potential role in controlling functions in breast cancer.\n   Network-based analysis of pathway deregulation: The pathways involved in necessary biological functions often exhibit alterations in pathological conditions. We have approached these alterations from a network perspective to study:\n The diversity of pathway deregulation in breast cancer, and how it may affect the effects of anti-cancer drugs\n The off-site targets of novel anti-cancer agents\n The changes in pathway connectivity observed in diabetic neuropathy\n   Network Pharmacology of Adverse Drug Reactions: Drugs may act on more than one site inside the organism. Sometimes this leads to adverse drug reactions, which may range from inconvenient to life-threatening. We have used network models to identify:\n Some gene targets that could be related to the manifestation of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy\n Repositioning opportunities for anti-inflammatory drugs\n Drug combinations with higher risk of adverse drug reactions\n   Metagenomics, Systems Pharmacology and Resistance: As part of our Cátedra CONACYT project, we are interested in assessing the effects of antibiotic agents in microbial communities, and the way in which these interactions lead to the emergence of resistance.\n Other Applications of Network, Data, and Complexity Sciences: Some other topics that I have been exploring lately include:\n Probabilistic multilayer networks. How to appropriately analyze and compare functional enrichment associated to modular structures in biological networks. Disease spreading in multilayer networks. The evolution of regulations regarding Genetically Modified Organisms in Mexico.
